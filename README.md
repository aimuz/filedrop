# Filedrop

This project is a fork of the original [Snapdrop](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop). We are very grateful for the work of the original developers.

## Why Filedrop?

The original Snapdrop project was acquired by LimeWire. This has led to concerns within the community regarding user privacy and data collection on the official `snapdrop.net` domain. For more context, you can read the community discussions [here](https://github.com/SnapDrop/snapdrop/issues/663).

This fork, **Filedrop**, was created to provide a version of Snapdrop that is free from third-party acquisitions and potential data tracking. Our goal is to continue the original spirit of Snapdrop as a simple, private, and local file sharing solution. This repository is based on the original source code, with the aim of ensuring it remains clean and independent.
